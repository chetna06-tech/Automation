# Automation
This Python script demonstrates a DevOps automation workflow using three different tools: Boto3, Kubernetes, and Ansible. Let’s break down what each part of the script does:

Provisioning Infrastructure with Boto3:
The provision_infrastructure() function uses the Boto3 library to create an Amazon EC2 instance.
It specifies the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), instance type, and key pair.
The created EC2 instance ID is printed.
Deploying Kubernetes with the Kubernetes Python Client:
The deploy_kubernetes() function uses the Kubernetes Python client to create a deployment.
It defines a Kubernetes deployment object for an Nginx application.
The deployment is created in the “default” namespace.
Running an Ansible Playbook with Ansible’s Python API:
The run_ansible_playbook() function sets up Ansible’s Python API context.
It specifies various Ansible options (e.g., connection type, forks, become settings).
Finally, it runs an Ansible playbook specified by the playbook_path.
The if __name__ == "__main__": block executes all three functions sequentially.
It provisions the EC2 instance, deploys the Kubernetes application, and runs the Ansible playbook.
The message “DevOps automation complete!” is printed at the end.
Remember to replace /path/to/your/playbook.yml with the actual path to your Ansible playbook. This script combines infrastructure provisioning, container orchestration, and configuration management – essential components of a DevOps workflow! 😊🚀
